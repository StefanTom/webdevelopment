                <p>For my projects I decided to go with the learning technologies portfolio where we list competencies and align a project with how we demonstrated those competencies. A competency I have that 
                    has been proved by working together with groups is communication. Using effective communication, I have collaborated with a group to create software that allows a user to interact with and 
                    analyze a stock chart. We met with a group once a week and cooperated to get this project completed. Throughout this project we worked with software such as python, docker, GitHub, and even
                     html. Our group didn’t have any issues with communicating over text, email, and discord. The artifact I chose was a screenshot of the files posted to my GitHub. All the files in that screenshot
                      are linked to each other and are necessary tools for the stock visualizer to function. Overall, it was a great learning experience cooperating with my group to get this project completed.</p>

                <p>The next large project I would like to mention was when a department ordered 20 brand new laptops for new users and employees. This project demonstrated the competency of 
                    organization and time management. When the equipment arrived it needed to be added to the inventory system that we use to track equipment, and the equipment also needed to be added
                     to active directory that allows and controls what security permissions the device has access to utilize. After each laptop is added by serial number, the laptops must be imaged
                      individually to have the University of Missouri attributes and software you see on university owned equipment. Imaging a device is a simple process that entails plugging in a drive 
                      with the image, signing into your admin credential account, and letting it upload so the device can be a blank slate with university attributes. Each laptop takes an hour to download
                       the image then requires an additional few hours to load software and configure group police updates. The artifact I included was boxes of all the devices that had to be set up. The project
                        took about a week to complete and no hinderances occurred other than when devices would inconsistently fall off the whitelist requiring my coworker to whitelist the IP address. Overall,
                         the project was successful, everything was done very quickly, and all devices were correctly labeled and imaged, which demonstrates time management.</p>

                         <p>The next competency I would like to align a project with was when we demonstrated teamwork. The project I worked on with a team was at my internship for the School of Medicine, we moved the 
                            entire department’s equipment across the building. This project demonstrated the competency of problem solving. This included the labeling a disassembling of around 20-30 people’s workstations, 
                            the physical movement of, and the setting up of a bunch of setups. Typically, it would take 2-3 days to move the department but due to our problem-solving skills, speed, and responsiveness it 
                            only took a morning. During the move, we encountered some issues such as ports not being properly hooked up, so we had to go into the networking closet and hook them up ourselves. The artifact
                             linked is a photo of my coworker Tom hooking up the correct port so a user could get internet. Overall, our team was very quick, resourceful, and responsive so the project went very smoothly
                              with only a few hiccups.</p>

                <p>Finally, the last project I would like to talk about is the project I worked on for my senior Capstone class. I worked together with 4 other group mates to create an application that allows
                    upcoming freshman Mizzou students living in the dorms to select the dorm they will be moving into. Following their selection they will be promted with room styles where they will select the kind
                    of room and have the ability to customize it with a large variety of furniture on top of the included layout. Our group made this project keeping in mind that many students are moving from out of town
                    and will have poor foresight into the furniture they should bring due to spacial limitations of living in a dorm. This project demonstrated efficient communication and teamwork in order to accomplish a takes
                    our group was given limited time and a budget to create an application that solves an issue. Our team worked efficiently together to create an application using free open source software that solved
                    an ongoing issue at our University.
