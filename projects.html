        <p> Welcome to my education overview! My name is Stefan Tomovski, and I will be going over my
            educational and career portfolio which will be outlining the experiences that have made me
            comfortable solving and discussing IT related issues. The purpose of this website will be to describe my
            resume, work experience, career experience, and my skills in a visual appealing style where the
            audience will be able to view my professional portfolio in a positive light.</p>


        <p>        My name is <strong>Stefan Tomovski</strong>, I am currently a senior in information technology. I am currently
            attaining my <strong>Bachelor of Science in Information Technology at the University of Missouri</strong>. I am also
            achieving my web development certificate along with my cybersecurity certificate and my digital media
            design certificate. I needed work experience so in my sophomore year I picked up an IT
            support/technician student job at the <em>University of Missouri’s School of Medicine</em>.  <br>The job and the
            experience I have attained while working there have been enlightening in teaching me what the future
            of information technology may hold. In high school I didn’t have much of an idea what I was going to do
            for school, so I went into IT, and it turned out to be a perfect fit where I have passion. A goal I have to
            complete by the end of this summer is to attain my CompTIA certification for networking and
            cybersecurity. As Information Technology is a very broad field of study, my specific interest is
            <em>cybersecurity</em>.
