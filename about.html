            <p>        My name is <strong>Stefan Tomovski</strong>, I am currently a senior in information technology. I am currently
                attaining my <strong>Bachelor of Science in Information Technology at the University of Missouri</strong>. I am also
                achieving my web development certificate along with my cybersecurity certificate and my digital media
                design certificate. I needed work experience so in my sophomore year I picked up an IT
                support/technician student job at the <em>University of Missouri’s School of Medicine</em>.  <br>The job and the
                experience I have attained while working there have been enlightening in teaching me what the future
                of information technology may hold. In high school I didn’t have much of an idea what I was going to do
                for school, so I went into IT, and it turned out to be a perfect fit where I have passion. A goal I have to
                complete by the end of this summer is to attain my CompTIA certification for networking and
                cybersecurity. As Information Technology is a very broad field of study, my specific interest is
                <em>cybersecurity</em>.
