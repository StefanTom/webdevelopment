    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <body>
        <p>        My name is <strong>Stefan Tomovski</strong>, I am currently a senior in information technology. I am currently
            attaining my <strong>Bachelor of Science in Information Technology at the University of Missouri</strong>. I am also
            achieving my web development certificate along with my cybersecurity certificate and my digital media
            design certificate. I needed work experience so in my sophomore year I picked up an IT
            support/technician student job at the <em>University of Missouri’s School of Medicine</em>.  <br>The job and the
            experience I have attained while working there have been enlightening in teaching me what the future
            of information technology may hold. In high school I didn’t have much of an idea what I was going to do
            for school, so I went into IT, and it turned out to be a perfect fit where I have passion. A goal I have to
            complete by the end of this summer is to attain my CompTIA certification for networking and
            cybersecurity. As Information Technology is a very broad field of study, my specific interest is
            <em>cybersecurity</em>.
