        <h2>Reflection</h2>

 
        <main class="main-content">
            <p>The internship has contributed to my long-term goals in many ways, most importantly in giving
            me the experience in working in customer service with users that have limited technological skills. The
            ability to be able to explain and communicate information in an easy-to-understand fashion is a
            detrimental skill to many aspects of any career in leadership. Being able to communicate effectively is an
            essential skill in any strategy of leadership. Leadership skills have also been emphasized during my class,
            Project and Team Management class offered with Gillian Maurer.</p>
            

            <p>The skill of communicating effectively will benefit me in future job interviews, communicating
            with clients or users, and in effectively communicating with management. For example, effective
            communication has been beneficial when I communicate with my team before, I go up to assist with an
            issue I am always making sure I know, who needs help, what the issue is, what we have tried, and any
            solutions my coworkers think might help. I also communicate effectively when I go to help users by
            asking what they have tried to resolve the issue and making sure they are satisfied when I finish
            troubleshooting the issue. The hands-on experiences and variety of lessons have greatly enhanced my
            technical abilities and has also equipped me with the right mindset needed to thrive in this quickly
            evolving industry. Finally, another way the internship has contributed to my long-term goals is by giving
            me an insight and opportunity to see the many roles that are involved in the field of technology.
            Most of the skills that I obtained were social skills and customer service-based skills. Working
            with computer issues is frustrating so I gained a huge life skill by learning to work with frustrated users.</p>

            <p>My freshman year of college occurred during the pandemic while everyone was home, so the IT related
            classes adapted to online. Due to student’s and professor’s preferences a vast majority of classes have
            stayed online. The pandemic combined with not many in-person classes did harm to my social skills as
            well as many others I assume. This job really helped me embolden my social skills and hinder social
            anxiety as well as strengthen my troubleshooting skills and all around improve my knowledge about
            computers.</p>

            <p>To conclude, my career experience combined with my education experience has allowed me to
            be well equipped for the field I decided to specialize in. Overall, a large amount of people with careers in
            the field of technology have started out with an entry level support job and worked their way up after
            learning the necessary skills. I believe that this job combined with my school experience has taught me
            the required technical skills about hardware and software that will be beneficial in cybersecurity. </p>
