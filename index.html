        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p> Welcome to my career portfolio! My name is Stefan Tomovski, and I will be going over my
        educational and career portfolio which will be outlining the experiences that have made me
        comfortable solving and discussing IT related issues. The purpose of this website will be to describe my
        resume, work experience, career experience, and my skills in a visual appealing style where the
        audience will be able to view my professional portfolio in a positive light.</p>
        
        <p>The goal of this website is to be accessible on my GitHub and give potential employers an easily digestible format of my resume and
        career/education experiences. GitHub is a useful website where code is posted, employers commonly
        look at websites such as this to see that a potential candidate has the skills they are looking for. The
        objective of this website would be to inform readers about my competencies and the way they align with
        projects I have completed. I will also use the website to list job experience and how it has influenced my
        problem-solving skills and all-around critical thinking.</p>
