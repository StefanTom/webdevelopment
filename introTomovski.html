    My name is Stefan Tomovski and I am a senior at Mizzou, majoring in Information Technology where I am also achieving a cybersecurity, web development certificate, and a digital media certificate. During my experience at Mizzou, I have learned a variety of topics applicable to my future career including basic networking skills, Linux skills, and many other programming based classes. This wide array of skills has given me a lot of general background knowledge that is essential to have a foundation when planning for a career in technology. Using the knowledge I have learned at Mizzou, I plan to further specialize into cybersecurity because Information Technology is a degree that covers a very broad area. Currently I am working a student role in an IT department at the Mizzou's School of Medicine. Specializing and getting a further education in cybersecurity, along with my previous education, will open me up to beginner jobs including analyst and product development positions.
